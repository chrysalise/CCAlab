# Welcome to the Community-Collaborative Approaches Lab

This serves as a knowledge repository that is maintained by an expert community of researchers in the HCI and CSCW space to help guide new to seasoned researchers in developing and engaging with communities in research work. While growing, the practice of community-collaborative approaches in HCI research is relatively nascent and practices for effectice and mutually-beneficial relationships between HCI researchers and community partners is  underdeveloped. This repository serves the need of researchers in this space for a shared resource that is vetted by the collective community, that includes shared examples of project goals, logistics, timelines, and considerations, with specific examples and reflections of past projects, and general guidelines that can be used for planning research projects and programs that feature community-collaborative approaches.


CONTENTS:
1. Community guidelines and goals of the repository
2. Motivations for CCA in computing projects
3. General timeline of CCA projects in computing
4. Highlights and Bloopers of CCA
